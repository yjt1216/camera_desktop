## 1.1.2

* Fix macOS build failure on Xcode 26+ by removing unavailable `AVCaptureSessionInterruptionReasonKey` (re-introduced in 1.1.1)
* Fix Windows build failure caused by implicit `wchar_t` to `char` conversion in debug logging

## 1.1.1

* Add comprehensive diagnostic logging across all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
* Log device enumeration, backend selection, pipeline construction, resolution selection, recording lifecycle, and error paths

## 1.1.0

* Add PipeWire camera portal support for Flatpak sandbox compatibility on Linux
* Automatically detect Flatpak environment and use `pipewiresrc` instead of `v4l2src`
* Request camera access via `org.freedesktop.portal.Camera` D-Bus interface
* Enumerate PipeWire camera nodes via `GstDeviceMonitor`
* Fall back to V4L2 if portal is unavailable or user denies permission
* No new build dependencies — uses GIO (D-Bus) and GStreamer APIs already linked

## 1.0.8

* Fix macOS build failure on Xcode 26+ by removing unavailable `AVCaptureSessionInterruptionReasonKey` (iOS-only API)

## 1.0.7

* Fix camera initialization failure on Intel Macs by selecting session preset after device discovery using `device.supportsSessionPreset()` with automatic fallback (1080p → 720p → high → medium)
* Make `canAddInput`/`canAddOutput` failures return a `FlutterError` instead of silently skipping, preventing blank-screen timeouts
* Increase initialization timeout from 8s to 15s for slower USB cameras
* Subscribe to `AVCaptureSessionRuntimeError`, `WasInterrupted`, and `InterruptionEnded` notifications and forward to Dart via `cameraError`
* Fix MethodChannel image stream fallback sending hardcoded `bytesPerRow` instead of actual value from `CVPixelBuffer`
* Add diagnostic logging at all critical points in macOS session setup

## 1.0.6

* Fix Xcode build warnings by declaring PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy as a resource bundle in iOS and macOS podspecs

## 1.0.5

* Fixes #1: conflict with camera_android and camera_avfoundation dependencies

## 1.0.4

* Fix macOS Swift Package Manager compatibility

## 1.0.3

* Fix hot restart FFI crash by replacing NativeCallable with polling

## 1.0.2

* Fix macOS use-after-free crash during engine teardown by making dispose synchronous/idempotent and guarding FFI callbacks

## 1.0.1

* Fix xcprivacy build warnings by declaring resource_bundles in iOS and macOS podspecs

## 1.0.0

First stable release of `camera_desktop`

### Platform implementations

* **macOS**, AVFoundation (`AVCaptureSession`, `AVAssetWriter`). Preview via `CVPixelBuffer` textures, H.264/AAC recording, native mirror support.
* **Windows**, Media Foundation (`IMFCaptureEngine`) with Direct3D 11 texture rendering. H.264/AAC recording via `IMFSinkWriter`.
* **Linux**, GStreamer + V4L2 (`v4l2src → videoconvert → appsink` pipeline). H.264/AAC recording with automatic encoder selection, native mirror via `videoflip`.

### Features

* Live camera preview with hardware-accelerated texture rendering on all platforms
* Photo capture, video recording, and real-time image streaming
* FFI-based zero-copy frame delivery (MethodChannel fallback for compatibility)
* Configurable resolution presets, FPS (5–60), and video bitrate
* Mirror/flip control (macOS and Linux)
* Pause/resume preview
* Runtime capability querying via `getPlatformCapabilities()`
